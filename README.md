üîç Check out my HR dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mei.liu4813/viz/SalesCustomersDashboardsDataWithBaraa/CustomersDashboard).
## Tools Used
**:art: Tableau:** A powerful tool for creating data visualizations and business intelligence dashboards, enabling insightful analysis and reporting.  
**:pencil2: draw.io:** Used to sketch the container structures for dashboard design.
**:computer: Visual Studio Code:** A lightweight, versatile code editor. I utilized Visual Studio Code to edit project scripts and manage images, ensuring seamless integration and synchronization with GitHub for version control and collaboration.  
**:octopus: Git & Github:** My go-to for version control and tracking my project progress.
# Steps to Build Dashboards
## :one: Define User Requirements
- :dart: Identify Target Audience:
- :moneybag: Sales

- Connected the dataset to Tableau. Identified the `Orders` tabls is a fact table while the `Customers`, `Location` and `Products` tables are all dimention tables.
- Built data model starting with `Orders` table.  

| Orders   |

- :1234: Calculated fields developed to enhance chart functionality:  

| Field Name |Formula   |                                                            
|------------|----------|
| Order Date (Years) | `YEAR([Order Date])`|
| Current Year Sales | `IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year]` <br> `THEN [Sales]` <br> `END`|
| %  Difference in Sales |  `(SUM([Current Year  Sales]) - SUM([Previous Sales]))` <br> `/ SUM([Previous Sales])`|
| Find Min & Max Sales | `IF SUM([Current Year Sales]) =` <br> `WINDOW_MAX (SUM([Current Year Sales]))` <br> `THEN SUM([Current Year  Sales])` <br> `ELSEIF` <br> `SUM([Current Year Sales]) =` <br> `WINDOW_MIN(SUM ([Current Year Sales]))` <br> `THEN SUM([Current Year  Sales])` <br> `END`|

Each chart type was selected for its ability to effectively communicate specific insights:
